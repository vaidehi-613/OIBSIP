Internship task - 1,4,5 

Task 1 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Task 4 :EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email
that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic
messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to
train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.


Task 5: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product.
